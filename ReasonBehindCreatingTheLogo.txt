	    	Inspiration  and reason behind creating the website logo

The reason of the logo is to demonstrate the people what content  the website have from noob to pro 
level of programming that means from beginner friendly level programming to high level Artificial 
Intelligence.

	While making this logo I have learned the editing, how to mix colours in logo (gradient), 
The logo is made from PicsArt android appliction.

	The Biggest motivation behind creating the logo and participating in open sorce is that I want 
to learn in public, exploring the computer science world and to expand my knowledge in copmuter field.
